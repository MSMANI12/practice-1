<h2>4.p</h2>
<p>In almost every sentence we make in<b> English</b>, we need to use an article. Articles are small but 
important words that precede nouns, and by using them correctly you will distinguish yourself as 
a good English speaker. Hereâ€™s a complete guide to<bdo> definite</bdo> and indefinite articles with help on
 when to use which and when to use neither.
 
<h2>5.address</h2>
<address>3/245,amman kovil street,muthukrishnaperi</address>

<h2>6.aside</h2>
<aside>h1</aside>

<h2>7.article</h2>
<article>A definite article is an article that marks a definite noun phrase.
 Definite articles such as English the are used to refer to a particular member of a group.
 It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified.</article>
 
 <h2>8.applet</h2>
 <h3>not suportes</h3>

For example, Sentence 1 uses the definite article and thus expresses a request for a particular book. In contrast, Sentence
 2 uses an indefinite article and thus conveys that the speaker would be satisfied with any book.
 
<h2>9.b</h2>
<b>Give me the book.
Give me a book.</b>
The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:

<h2>1o.button</h2>
<button>The cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the Brassica genus.</button>

<h2>11.code</h2>
<code>However, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to</code>
